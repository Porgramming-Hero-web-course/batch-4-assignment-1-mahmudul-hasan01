*/ In TypeScript, union and intersection types are powerful tools that enhance type safety and flexibility. A union type allows a variable to hold values from multiple types, enabling more flexible code. For example, string | number means a variable can be either a string or a number. Intersection types, on the other hand, combine multiple types into one, ensuring the variable meets all specified type requirements. This is useful for merging different object types with distinct properties. By supporting union and intersection types, TypeScript improves code versatility while helping catch errors at compile time, making code more robust and expressive. /*
